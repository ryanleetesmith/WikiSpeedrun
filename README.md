### WikiSpeedrun ###

This project seeks to automate the trend of 'speedrunnning' wikipedia by starting on one page and clicking links until you manage to get to the desired destination page.

**environment**: This project was developed in Java 15.

### Description

Wikiracer...

Instructions for running
WikiRacer.java will require two command line arguments - the last portion of the start and end pages respectively.
For example, if you wanted to go from the Wikipedia page for Strawberry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry) to the page for Applesauce (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_sauce),
your arguments would be Strawberry & Apple_sauce
These arguments are case sensitive to account for duplicate wiki page nonsense that exists behind the scenes.

Error Handling...


### Potential Future Features:
Adding a GUI for ease of use
Reordering page links to visit based on what a human might associate with the final result
